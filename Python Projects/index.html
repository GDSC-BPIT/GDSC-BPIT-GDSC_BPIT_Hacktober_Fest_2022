            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">While the fear of the novel coronavirus pandemic is still spreading, air pollution and noise pollution are significantly decreasing. On the one hand, people are staying indoors to avoid chances of contamination. On the other hand, sightings of migratory birds, and endangered species of animals have become daily updates on social media. The novel coronavirus may be claiming victims all across the globe and keeping people sealed indoors due to the spiralling fear and mass confusion, it seems so have certain positive effects in India as well as abroad.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">The Reserve Bank of India and the government will have to act quickly as a united front. Think tax cuts, increased liquidity, forbearance to lenders, credit and credit-guarantee to SMEs, and lower interest rates.

                    The post-COVID-19 scenario for India does not look as grim as most people deem it to be according to leading economists of the country. Combined with a stimulus package of $100-120 billion, it will restore the purchasing power to the populace sooner than earlier deemed during the onset of the COVID-19 crises.
                    
                    If India takes a leaf out of the pages of the US and Singapore economies and trusts the indigenous businesses, the economic recovery will be much sooner for the country.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Greenhouse gas emissions and pollution levels across the country have fallen significantly. Half a year ago Delhi was gasping for a breath of fresh air saw “positively alpine” air quality a couple of days ago. Delhi is currently enjoying one of the lowest air pollution levels seen in the past decade or longer. The same is true for other metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Kolkata.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Up until the beginning of 2020, it was all about internationalization and globalization of businesses. Right now, it's all about staying home, inquiring about the health of your neighbours, leaving home only to buy locally and boosting the local community.

                    This lockdown has inspired family-time and local-time among the millions of citizens living in the metros of the country. While people are rarely leaving their homes, if at all, they are spending more time on streaming platforms, playing board games with their family and spending quality time with their kids.
