The group had %d members and their head was %s. On one fine day, they decided to go to river %s to take a bath .
After bathing ,  the head did the head count but their were only %d people . One of them was missing .
They were all worried .
Actaully , the head forgot to count itself and therefore , when ever they used to count the total number to people one would be missing .
Just then a %s seller passed by them . Hearing thier dilemma , he offerd help.
He asked each member to hold one %s and then put it down on ground .
On counting the total number of %s , there were %d of them.
So the musicians were relieved and the %s seller was happy to sell off %d %s."""%(a,n,p,z,h,r,y,t,t,t,z,t,z,t))
